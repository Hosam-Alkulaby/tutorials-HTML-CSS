        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>


        <h2>LISTS</h2>


        <P>This is how to make unorder list:</P>


        <ul>

        <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unorder list)</li>
        <li>Add each items in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        
        </ul>


        <p>This is what ordered list looks like:</p>


        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>but,the list items elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the number increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be notcing thigs is this precise order,becuase<br>
                 this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol> 

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>sometime</em>,you need to draw attention to a particular word or <br> phrase.</p>
        <p>Other time,you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance <br>
        of a word or phrase.</p>

        <p><em><strong>somtimes you neet to shout!</strong></em></p>



        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
